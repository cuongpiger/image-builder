Thank you so much for taking the time to report your issue to `image-builder` ❤️

Before submitting a new issue please ensure the following:
- You have checked the current open issues to see if there is already a matching report
- You are able to reproduce the issue with image-builder alone.

Unfortunately we are unable to provide support for issues where image-builder is used as part of another solution (for example EKS-Anywhere) and in those situation we recommend raising the issue with the project making use of image-builder.

If you'd like to discuss any issues or would like to confirm if something is an issue with image-builder or not before raising an issue please reach out to us with any of the communication methods listed on the readme (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder#community-discussion-contribution-and-support).
